# ðŸ§  Brain Tumor Classification

This project implements an **image classification model** for brain tumor detection using deep learning. The model is trained on augmented MRI scan images and classifies them into four categories:

- **Glioma**
- **Meningioma**
- **Pituitary**
- **Healthy**

The project includes:
- Data preprocessing and augmentation
- Hyperparameter optimization with Keras Tuner
- Model training with early stopping
- Final evaluation and sample visualizations
